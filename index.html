        She was a girl<br/>
        with lines of blueprints<br/>
        and dreams taller than the highest buildings<br/><br/>

        from halls of NIT HAMIRPUR<br/>
        she carried her curiosity<br/>
        like a small flame<br/>
        lighting up every dark corner of architecture<br/><br/>

        then she stepped into the world<br/>
        where numbers meet strategy<br/>
        MBA at IIM KOZHIKODE<br/>
        taught her the language of growth<br/>
        the rhythm of business<br/>
        the poetry of possibility<br/><br/>

        she learned to listen<br/>
        to the whispers of telecom towers<br/>
        to the stories of markets far and wide<br/>
        and she turned them into insights<br/>
        like an artist turning sketches into masterpieces<br/><br/>

        now she is helping <strong>real estate clients</strong><br/>
        with <strong>strategic consulting, market insights, and business growth</strong><br/>
        bringing clarity, actionable strategy, and vision<br/><br/>

        she is bold<br/>
        she is precise<br/>
        she is elegant<br/>
        and she is ready<br/>
        to help <strong>young professionals and students</strong><br/>
        to build not just careers<br/>
        but confidence, clarity, and wings<br/><br/>

        because she knows<br/>
        that every journey begins<br/>
        with one small step<br/>
        and the courage to keep walking<br/><br/>

        if you resonate with her story<br/>
        feel free to reach out to her<br/>
        for guidance, mentorship, or <strong>hand-holding in your professional journey</strong>
